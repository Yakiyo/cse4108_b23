Was unable to get the question later on, but the gist of it was that, u were given a number `n`,
after that u were given `n` number of inputs, all the numbers were between 1 to 100.

You had to separate each number into its respective percentile.
1st percentile = 1 - 10
2nd percentile = 11 - 20
3rd percentile = 21 - 30
and so on.

Then print the frequency of numbers in each percentile alongside the percentile number
Then find total average of the entire input numbers where each percentile's value would be
its middle point multiplied by its frequency
