# CSE 4108 solutions - Batch 23

My solutions to the lab tasks of CSE 4108 taken by Moniruzzaman sir. PDF questions of each lab are provided
in their respective folders and so are the solutions. Some questions or solution may or may not be missing.

Solutions may contain errors tho unlikely. But if you find any, feel free to open an issue and lmk. 

There is a convenient [build](./build) script provided for anyone who has [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) installed. You can provide lab no and task no to the script and it will compile and run the appropiate solution.

```bash
# to run lab 8 task 2

$ ./build 8 2
```
